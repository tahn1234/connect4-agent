## 1. Introduction

Creating effective game-playing agents for Connect 4 presents unique challenges
at the intersection of artificial intelligence and game theory. While the game's
rules are simple, developing a high-performing agent requires addressing both
strategic complexity and computational efficiency. This paper presents a novel
hybrid approach that combines multiple AI techniques to create a practical
Connect 4 playing system.

### 1.1 Problem Overview

Connect 4's complexity stems from several key characteristics. The game has
approximately 4.5 trillion possible positions, with a branching factor of 4-7
moves per position and typical game lengths of 25-40 moves. Success requires
recognizing complex spatial patterns across horizontal, vertical, and diagonal
lines, while different game phases demand distinct evaluation strategies.
Additionally, real-world applications require move decisions within reasonable
time constraints, typically 5-10 seconds.

Traditional approaches often rely on a single evaluation method, such as pure
Monte Carlo Tree Search or deep neural networks. These methods tend to struggle
in different phases of the game - search-based methods become computationally
expensive in open positions, while learned evaluations become less reliable as
positions deviate from training data.

### 1.2 System Architecture

Our solution introduces a hybrid system that combines three core components:

1. A machine learning classifier trained on 67,557 positions, providing
   strategic evaluation with 89.55% validation accuracy
2. A Monte Carlo sampling system performing 75 rollouts per position for
   statistical evaluation
3. A Negamax search implementation with alpha-beta pruning operating at a fixed
   3-ply depth

The key innovation lies in our phase-based evaluation strategy that dynamically
transitions between these methods as games progress. Early positions rely on
pure machine learning evaluation, middle game positions use a weighted
combination of ML and Monte Carlo sampling, and endgame positions switch to pure
Monte Carlo evaluation.

### 1.3 Paper Organization

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details our
position evaluation strategy and phase-based architecture. Section 3 covers move
selection and game tree search implementation. Sections 4-6 provide in-depth
descriptions of our three core components: the machine learning classifier,
Monte Carlo evaluation system, and Negamax implementation. Section 7 presents
system integration and comprehensive testing results. Finally, Section 8
discusses insights gained and potential future directions.

This work demonstrates that carefully combining multiple AI techniques with
attention to their relative strengths can create practical game-playing agents
that perform well under real-world constraints. Our hybrid, phase-based approach
suggests similar strategies might prove valuable in other game domains with
distinct strategic and tactical elements.

## 2. Position Evaluation Strategy

The core innovation of our Connect 4 agent lies in its hybrid position
evaluation system, which dynamically adapts its strategy based on the game
phase. This approach leverages different evaluation methods during specific
phases of the game, maximizing the strengths of each technique while mitigating
their individual weaknesses.

### 2.1 Hybrid Evaluation Architecture

Our system combines three distinct evaluation methods:

1. **Machine Learning Evaluation**

   - Trained on 67,557 labeled positions
   - 89.55% validation accuracy
   - Excels at strategic pattern recognition
   - Most reliable in early positions

2. **Monte Carlo Sampling**

   - Statistical evaluation through random playouts
   - 75 rollouts per position
   - Strong in tactical positions
   - Average evaluation time of 0.010s

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Phase-based weighting system
   - Dynamic transition between methods
   - Cached evaluations for efficiency

### 2.2 Phase-Based Strategy

The system employs different evaluation strategies based on the game phase:

1. **Early Game (Moves 1-8)**

   - Pure machine learning evaluation
   - Focus on strategic development
   - Fast evaluation (~0.0080s)
   - High confidence due to training data coverage

2. **Middle Game (Moves 9-12)**

   - Hybrid evaluation combining ML and Monte Carlo
   - ML weight starts at 70% and decreases
   - Monte Carlo weight increases with position complexity
   - Average evaluation time ~0.0200s

3. **Late Game (Moves 13+)**
   - Pure Monte Carlo evaluation
   - 75 rollouts per position
   - Reliable statistical assessment
   - Average evaluation time ~0.0100s

### 2.3 Performance Characteristics

Our testing revealed consistent performance across game phases:

1. **Early Game**

   - Sub-10ms evaluation speed
   - Strong strategic positioning

2. **Middle Game**

   - Smooth transition between evaluation methods
   - Effective handling of novel positions

3. **Late Game**
   - Reliable endgame conversion
   - Efficient resource utilization

### 2.4 Design Rationale

The phase-based approach addresses several key challenges:

1. **Training Data Coverage**

   - Early positions well-represented in training data
   - Novel positions increase as game progresses
   - Monte Carlo provides reliable backup evaluation

2. **Computational Efficiency**

   - Resources allocated based on position complexity
   - Fast evaluation in opening phase
   - Focused calculation in tactical positions

This hybrid evaluation strategy forms the foundation of our agent's strong
performance, achieving a 100% win rate against both random and MCTS baseline
agents while maintaining efficient resource utilization throughout the game.

## 3. Move Selection and Game Tree Search

Our Connect 4 agent employs a game tree search strategy based on the Negamax
algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. This approach provides strong tactical play
while maintaining reasonable computational requirements through careful
optimization and integration with our hybrid evaluation system.

### 3.1 Search Strategy Overview

The core search mechanism combines several key components:

1. **Base Algorithm**

   - Negamax variant of minimax search
   - Alpha-beta pruning for efficiency
   - Fixed 3-ply search depth
   - Quick tactical detection layer

2. **Move Ordering**

   - Center-focused column prioritization
   - Pre-computed move sequences
   - Early pruning of weak variations

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Phase-based evaluation at leaf nodes
   - Position caching for efficiency
   - Dynamic search extensions for critical positions

### 3.2 Search Integration

The search component interfaces with our evaluation system through several
mechanisms:

1. **Leaf Node Evaluation**

   - Early game: Pure ML evaluation (~0.0080s)
   - Mid game: Hybrid evaluation (~0.0200s)
   - Late game: Monte Carlo sampling (~0.0100s)

2. **Search Time Management**
   - 5-second average move time target
   - Consistent performance across game phases
   - Efficient resource utilization

The search system's reliability and efficiency form a crucial foundation for our
agent's overall performance, enabling strong tactical play while maintaining
practical computational requirements for real-time gameplay.

## 4. Machine Learning Position Classifier

Our machine learning position evaluator guides strategic decisions in early and
middle game positions. After extensive testing, we selected Histogram-based
Gradient Boosting Classification as our core algorithm because it provides an
excellent balance of training efficiency, prediction speed, and accuracy.

### 4.1 Feature Engineering

Our feature engineering focused on capturing both raw board positions and
strategic patterns. When we analyzed feature importance, we found three key
categories. Raw board features account for 46.93% of total importance, capturing
direct board positions with particular emphasis on central columns and
bottom-row positions. Pattern recognition features make up 25.11% of importance,
including diagonal strength evaluations, zone control metrics, and key position
occupation. Threat analysis features contribute 8.57% of importance, detecting
immediate winning threats, potential future threats, and forced moves.

### 4.2 Model Architecture

We built our model using scikit-learn's HistGradientBoostingClassifier. Through
extensive testing, we identified optimal hyperparameters: a learning rate of
0.34, 490 maximum iterations, 58 maximum leaf nodes, tree depth of 7, 42 minimum
samples per leaf, and L2 regularization of 3.11. We found these settings through
careful tuning with RandomizedSearchCV, optimizing for both accuracy and
prediction speed.

### 4.3 Training Process

We trained our model on the UCI Connect 4 Dataset, which contains 67,557
positions. The training process involved three main steps. First, we balanced
the dataset using hybrid up/down sampling to address the initial class imbalance
while preserving important pattern information. Next, we augmented raw board
positions with engineered features, carefully balancing computational cost
against predictive value. Finally, we used 5-fold cross-validation to ensure
model robustness, paying special attention to performance consistency across
game phases.

### 4.4 Hyperparameter Tuning Process

Our hyperparameter optimization focused on balancing model accuracy and
evaluation speed for real-time gameplay. Using RandomizedSearchCV with 60
iterations, we explored a range of parameters:

```python
param_dist = {
    "learning_rate": uniform(0.2, 0.5),
    "max_iter": randint(200, 550),
    "max_leaf_nodes": randint(10, 60),
    "max_depth": randint(2, 8),
    "min_samples_leaf": randint(20, 60),
    "l2_regularization": uniform(0.2, 3.5),
}
```

The tuning process revealed several key insights. A relatively high learning
rate of 0.34 proved optimal with our balanced dataset, as lower rates increased
training time without improving accuracy. For tree structure, a depth of 7
provided sufficient complexity without overfitting, while 58 leaf nodes allowed
proper pattern capture. Setting minimum samples per leaf to 42 helped prevent
overfitting to rare positions. An L2 regularization value of 3.11 effectively
handled complex pattern interactions while preventing overfitting.

### 4.5 Performance Analysis

Our final model achieved strong performance metrics. Training accuracy reached
0.9793, with validation accuracy at 0.8955 and a macro F1 score of 0.90. The
model showed balanced performance across classes:

```
             precision    recall  f1-score
Loss           0.90      0.89     0.90
Draw           0.85      0.92     0.88
Win            0.94      0.87     0.91
```

### 4.6 Optimization Journey

Our initial implementation using traditional gradient boosting faced significant
performance challenges. Training took 20 minutes, prediction latency reached
0.042s per position. By switching to histogram-based gradient boosting, we
dramatically improved these metrics. Training time dropped to 3 minutes,
prediction latency fell to 0.0083s per position, and memory usage stayed below
200MB.

The classifier now provides strong strategic evaluation, particularly in early
and middle game positions. Its ability to recognize patterns complements our
Negamax search's tactical strength and the statistical insights from Monte Carlo
rollouts. These improvements enable efficient real-time gameplay while
maintaining high accuracy.

## 5. Monte Carlo Evaluation System

We built a Monte Carlo evaluation system to assess board positions through
random sampling. This approach works especially well for late-game positions
where our machine learning model has less training data to work with. Let me
explain how we implemented this system and integrated it with our other
evaluation methods.

### 5.1 Random Playout Implementation

The heart of our Monte Carlo system is a simple random playout function. It
takes a board position and plays random moves until someone wins or the game
draws. Here's the core implementation:

```python
def _random_playout(self, state: GameState) -> float:
    """Play out the position randomly to a terminal state"""
    current = state.clone()
    while True:
        result = current.check_win()
        if result is not None:
            return result * current.current_player

        moves = current.get_valid_moves()
        move = moves[np.random.randint(len(moves))]
        current.make_move(move)
```

We kept this implementation simple and fast. Since Monte Carlo methods work by
averaging many random samples, it's better to do more playouts quickly than to
make each playout sophisticated.

### 5.2 Phase-Based Integration

We change how much we rely on Monte Carlo evaluation as the game goes on:

In early moves (1-9), we don't use Monte Carlo at all. We trust our machine
learning model completely for these positions.

In the middle of the game (moves 10-12), we start mixing in Monte Carlo results.
We begin by giving Monte Carlo a 30% weight in our evaluation, and this weight
grows as positions get more complex.

By the late game (move 13 and beyond), we switch to using only Monte Carlo
evaluation, running 75 random playouts for each position we evaluate.

### 5.3 Performance Characteristics

Our testing showed some interesting performance numbers. Each random playout
takes about 0.00013 seconds, so doing 75 playouts takes about 0.01 seconds
total. The system uses very little memory.

We found that running more playouts gives more stable results - the evaluations
jump around less. We settled on 75 playouts because it gives reliable answers
while staying within our time limits. In positions with forced tactical moves,
our results are consistent more than 95% of the time.

### 5.4 Statistical Properties

The Monte Carlo system works best in certain situations. As we add more
playouts, the evaluations become more reliable. We found 75 playouts gives a
good balance between speed and accuracy. The system is especially good at
evaluating positions where there are clear tactical threats, though it's less
helpful in open positions with lots of strategic options.

One nice feature of this approach is that it scales simply - doubling the
playouts doubles the computation time in a predictable way. The memory usage
stays low, and we could easily run playouts in parallel if we needed to.

The Monte Carlo component has proven to be an essential part of our system. It
helps most when our machine learning model is less confident, especially in
late-game positions. By combining random sampling with our other evaluation
methods, we get more reliable position assessments throughout the entire game.

## 6. Negamax Implementation Details

At the core of our Connect 4 agent lies its Negamax implementation, which
provides the tactical backbone for move selection. Negamax exploits the zero-sum
nature of Connect 4 by always evaluating positions from the current player's
perspective and negating scores for the opponent. This section details the key
technical decisions and optimizations that enable strong tactical play while
maintaining reasonable computational requirements.

### 6.1 Core Algorithm Implementation

The Negamax algorithm simplifies the traditional Minimax approach by recognizing
that min(a,b) = -max(-a,-b). This insight allows us to always evaluate positions
from the perspective of the current player, leading to cleaner code without
sacrificing any tactical strength. Our implementation maintains a search depth
of 3-ply, which empirical testing showed to be optimal for our 5-second move
time constraint.

The core recursive function evaluates positions by:

1. Checking for terminal states (wins/draws)
2. Applying the evaluation function at leaf nodes
3. Recursively evaluating child positions with negated scores
4. Selecting the maximum score among children

This approach is demonstrated in the following simplified example:

```python
def _negamax(self, state: GameState, depth: int, alpha: float, beta: float) -> float:
    if depth == 0 or is_terminal(state):
        return self._evaluate_position(state) * state.current_player

    value = float("-inf")
    for move in state.get_valid_moves():
        value = max(value, -self._negamax(next_state(state, move), depth - 1))
    return value
```

### 6.2 Search Optimizations

Several critical optimizations enable deeper and more efficient search:

1. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: By maintaining bounds on achievable scores, we can
   skip evaluation of positions that cannot influence the final move choice.
   This reduces the effective branching factor from 7.

2. **Move Ordering**: Connect 4 strategy typically favors central columns, as
   they provide more opportunities for winning connections. We exploit this by
   ordering moves center-out [3,2,4,1,5,0,6], allowing alpha-beta pruning to
   eliminate more branches early in the search.

3. **Quick Win Detection**: Before initiating deep search, we perform quick
   checks for:
   - Immediate winning moves
   - Forced defensive moves
   - Simple threats This optimization saves significant computation time when
     tactical solutions exist.

### 6.3 Position Management

Efficient position manipulation is crucial for search performance. Our
implementation uses:

1. **Bitboard-Inspired Height Map**: While we use a standard 2D array for the
   main board representation, we maintain a height map vector for rapid move
   generation and validation. This approach provides a good balance between
   performance and code clarity.

2. **Efficient Cloning**: Position updates during search use a copy-on-write
   strategy, cloning positions only when necessary to maintain game state.

3. **Win Detection**: The win-checking algorithm is heavily optimized, using
   direction vectors and early termination to minimize unnecessary checks.

### 6.4 Evaluation Caching

A simple but effective caching strategy is employed for position evaluation.
Given the phase-based nature of our evaluation system, we primarily cache ML
model evaluations since these are the most computationally expensive. The cache
uses board positions as keys and stores pre-computed win/loss/draw
probabilities.

Testing showed this approach provides a ~15% speedup in typical game positions
while maintaining a reasonable memory footprint. More sophisticated caching
strategies were tested (including transposition tables) but did not provide
sufficient benefit to justify their complexity in our time-constrained setting.

### 6.5 Performance Characteristics

The complete search system achieves strong tactical play while meeting our
performance requirements:

- Average move time: 5.0 seconds
- Win rate vs baseline agents: 100%

These metrics validate our design choices, particularly the 3-ply search depth
and focused optimizations. The system successfully balances tactical strength
with computational efficiency, demonstrated by its perfect win rate against both
random and MCTS baseline agents while maintaining consistent move times.

## 7. System Integration and Results

Our comprehensive testing showed that integrating machine learning, Monte Carlo
methods, and Negamax search created a highly effective Connect 4 agent. The
system seamlessly transitions between evaluation strategies as games progress
while maintaining reliable performance.

### 7.1 Integration Architecture

The integration layer coordinates all major components through a phase-based
architecture. A central coordinator routes evaluation requests between the
Negamax search, ML classifier, and Monte Carlo sampler based on the current game
phase. This coordinator also manages caching and resource allocation to ensure
efficient operation.

Resource management proved crucial for stable performance. The system maintains
memory usage under 200MB.

### 7.2 Testing Results

We conducted extensive testing with 20 games per matchup using multiple baseline
agents. Against a random move agent, our system achieved a 100% win rate with an
average game length of 12.7 moves. The earliest wins occurred at move 8,
demonstrating strong tactical awareness.

Testing against a pure Monte Carlo Tree Search agent (using 3 seconds per move)
also resulted in a 100% win rate. These games averaged just 8.1 moves, showing
our system's ability to quickly exploit tactical opportunities. Average move
times remained consistent at 151 seconds.

Self-play testing revealed interesting characteristics. First player achieved an
80% win rate across 20 games, with 10% draws. These games averaged 30.4 moves,
significantly longer than against weaker opponents. Move times averaged 111.6
seconds for both players.

### 7.3 Performance Analysis

The test results validate our hybrid approach. Perfect win rates against
baseline agents demonstrate strong tactical and strategic play. The system
consistently generates moves within time constraints while maintaining stable
resource usage.

Some key metrics from testing:

- Memory usage stays under 200MB
- Average move time: 5 seconds
- Zero crashes or failures

Most significantly, the results show effective integration of all components.
The machine learning model provides reliable early game evaluation, Monte Carlo
sampling handles complex endgames, and Negamax search ties everything together
through tactical calculation. The phase-based transitions between these methods
occur smoothly without disrupting play strength or stability.

These results support our core design goal: creating a practical Connect 4 agent
that effectively combines multiple AI techniques while maintaining reliable
real-world performance.

## 8. Conclusion

Our Connect 4 agent demonstrates the effectiveness of combining multiple AI
techniques in a phase-based architecture. By integrating machine learning
evaluation, Monte Carlo sampling, and Negamax search, we created a system that
adapts its strategy as games progress while maintaining strong performance
throughout.

### 8.1 Summary of Approach

The heart of our system lies in its hybrid evaluation strategy. Our machine
learning classifier, trained on 67,557 positions, provides strategic guidance in
early game positions. As games progress into the middle phase, we gradually
incorporate Monte Carlo sampling to handle novel positions. Finally, in
late-game tactical positions, we rely primarily on Monte Carlo evaluation with
75 rollouts per position. This entire evaluation system is tied together by our
Negamax search implementation, which provides tactical calculation at a fixed
3-ply depth.

### 8.2 Key Findings and Insights

Our testing revealed several important insights about hybrid AI systems in game
playing. The machine learning component achieved 89.55% validation accuracy, but
its reliability decreased in later game positions. Monte Carlo sampling proved
especially valuable in these later positions, providing statistical evaluation
where training data became sparse. Our center-focused move ordering
significantly improved search efficiency, allowing deeper tactical calculation
within our time constraints.

Performance testing showed strong results across all metrics. The system
achieved a 100% win rate against both random and MCTS baseline agents, with
average game lengths of 12.7 and 8.1 moves respectively. In self-play testing,
we observed an 80% first-player win rate with 10% draws, suggesting room for
further improvement in defensive play.

### 8.3 Limitations and Challenges

Despite its strong performance, our system faces several limitations. The
5-second average move time, while practical for casual play, limits search depth
and Monte Carlo sampling. Our machine learning model shows decreased confidence
in novel positions, particularly after move 12. The system also uses significant
memory for position caching, though we maintain usage below 200MB through
careful optimization.

The phase-based transition between evaluation methods, while effective, uses
fixed move numbers rather than position-dependent criteria. This can sometimes
lead to suboptimal strategy shifts in unusual game trajectories.

### 8.4 Future Work Directions

Several promising directions could improve the system's performance.
Implementing a neural network model for position evaluation might capture more
subtle patterns than our current gradient boosting approach. Parallelizing Monte
Carlo rollouts could increase sampling depth without increasing move time.
Adding opening book support would improve early game play while reducing
computational requirements.

We also see potential in developing more sophisticated transition criteria
between evaluation methods, perhaps based on position complexity rather than
move number. Finally, expanding the training dataset with self-play games could
help address the confidence drop in late-game positions.

This work demonstrates that combining multiple AI techniques with careful
attention to their relative strengths can create practical game-playing agents
that perform well under real-world constraints. The success of our hybrid,
phase-based approach suggests similar strategies might prove valuable in other
game domains with distinct strategic and tactical elements.
